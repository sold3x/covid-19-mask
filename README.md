covid19 protection mask

In the course of the current Covid19 pandemic, we became aware of the face protection project by Josef Prusa https://www.prusa3d.com/covid19/. 

Together with doctors and nurses from everyday clinical practice, we have completely revised this face protection 
and optimized it in accordance with practical requirements. 

We would be happy to manufacture the mask for you. Please visit https://www.soldex.de for more informations.

If you have your own 3D printer, you are welcome to use our template free of charge.
